## Welcome to the TOAD GUI Library

[toad.js](https://github.com/markandre13/toad.js#readme) brings some of the ideas from the TOAD C++ GUI library ([UNIX/X11](https://github.com/markandre13/toad-x11#readme), [macOS/Cocoa](https://github.com/markandre13/toad-macosx#readme)) to the web.

* intended for the development of [Progressive Web Apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Web_Apps)
* supports the separation of frontend (view) and business domain (model) code via the MVC pattern
* allows to bind view and model either via HTML or JSX
* not a HTML template library like Handlebars, Angular, React or Vue 😜 but a collection of ready-made 
  view and model classes

toad.js makes use of new web technologes like Custom Elements, Shadow DOM and JSX.

Development is happening in my spare time and focused on Safari, the Desktop and to support the development of [workflow](https://github.com/markandre13/workflow#readme) and [makehuman.js](https://github.com/markandre13/makehuman.js#readme).

But it _should_ basically work on any other modern browser.
